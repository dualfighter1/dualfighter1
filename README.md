Hello there, My name is Noelle Jade! I'm bored cat girl struggling to really do much in life. <br>
I struggle to focus and get things done but i still try. Please be patient with me >~< <br>
I enjoy puzzles, cooking, reading and playing a couple of games (Terraria and Limbus Company) <br>
The funny people inside the computer box are all friends and I'd be nothing without them, much love and care to all of them <3

Current projects: Setting up a Dell Poweredge R320
