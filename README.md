Im just your average online geek and slightly cringe little nya.

I enjoy coding, though im not the best at it.

This is where i will post all ny actual projects and work in progress things. 
They wont all be good quality but eh thats what you get when you look at code written by a cat.

My mostly untouched google dev page can be found [Here](https://g.dev/Noelle_Jade)

My current project is a Ren'Py Visual Novel Base which can be found [Here](https://github.com/dualfighter1/Renpy-VN-Template)

I hope you have a good day!!!
